* Many things can go wrong on a computer that might cause it to lose data: 
 * Hard disks can fail, 
 * you might accidentally enter some extremely destructive command,
 * a cracker might break into your system,
 * or a user might accidentally delete a file,
 
* To protect against such problems, it’s important that you maintain good backups of the computer. 
* To do this, select appropriate backup hardware, choose a backup program, and implement backups on a regular schedule. You should also have a plan in place to recover some or all of your data should the need arise.
